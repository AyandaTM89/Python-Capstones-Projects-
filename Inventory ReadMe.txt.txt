a Shoe class should be
defined.
o In the Shoe class, create a function (read_data()) that will
implement a try-except block for reading the following information
from the file:
● country,
● code,
● product,
● cost, and
● quantity.




o Create at least 5 shoe objects and store these in a list. Add
functionality to search products in the objects list by code.
o Write code to determine the product with the lowest quantity, and
restock it.
o Write code to determine the product with the highest quantity and
mark it up as being for sale.
o You will have noticed that in the original data, there are only five
columns. Write a function, value_per_item(), to calculate the value
(or total worth) of each item entered. (Please keep the formula for
value in mind; value = cost * quantity.) This function should then
create a sixth column for each product, named value.
o Represent the data from the objects list in a table format using
Python’s tabulate module, with the new value column added.
